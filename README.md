This project represents a template for a deployment system using fabric.
An actual implementation would first need to install this template module
into the desired python environment using:

$ pip install .

Then just copy the whole fabfile directory to the top-level directory
of the project which is intended to use this fabric installation
mechansim and adjust the content of the file APPspecific.py
